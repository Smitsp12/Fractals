# Fractals
Mandelbrot Set is an example of how a simple rule when iterated over a complex space results in a shape with intricate boundary. It is a set of complex numbers (c) that satisfies the quadratic equation, starting with z = 0 and iterating the equation until arg(z) stays with 2 for any chosen maximum number of iterations. If any complex number (c) does not lead to arg(z) exceeding 2 until maximum iterations are performed, then it becomes a part of the Mandelbrot set.

The boundary of this set is self repeating structure when zoomed in, revealing its fine details. Of course the resolution depends on how finely the grid is chosen in the complex space. Check out the matplotlib generated images above, highlighting the intricate boundary of the Mandelbrot set.
